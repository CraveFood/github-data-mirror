UNDER DEVELOPMENT
-----------------

This project aims to mirror all Github issues, PR and release data of a given organization into a local MongoDB for analytics purposes.

The goal is to perform an initial sync using Github REST APIs and then update the DB everytime Github WebHooks send an event.
