Github Data Mirror!
==================

This project aims to mirror all Github issues, PR and release data of a given organization into a local MongoDB for analytics purposes.

The goal is to perform an initial sync using Github REST APIs and then update the DB everytime Github WebHooks send an event.


MongoDB Schema
--------------

The local MongoDB is called `github` and have one collection for each synced object.

The Collections are:

* github.issues
* github.pulls
* github.releases

Each collection stores the exact return from the Github API for that object (with the exception of `issues` that have and extra attribute called `events` which stores all events related to that issue â€“ like label, unlabeled, opened, reopened, etc).


Running using Docker Compose
----------------------------
Note: This method requires that docker and docker-compose are previously installed in your machine.


To run Github-data-mirror using Docker Compose you need to first set your environment variables in the file `webhook.env`. We currently have an example file named `webhook.env.example` that could be copied and changed.


Performing the initial Sync
---------------------------

To sync all data from all repos from a given organization you need to run the command 
`python manage.py ghsync --organization=<orgname>`


Configuring the organization Webhook
-------------------------------------

Access Github webhook settings page for the organization and then click in the `Webhooks` option (the link should be something like `https://github.com/organizations/<orgname>/settings/hooks`).

Click in `Add webhook`. In the Payload URL field add the URL of your service; in Content type choose `application/json` and in Secret add the Random string you previously set in your environment variables. Enable SSL verifications, select the option `Send me everything` and that's it.

You can also send a test payload to make sure your service is working.

From now on your local MongoDB should be receiving every updates from the currently sync objects.
